LOG SCHEMA DEFINITION
This file defines the structure of every log entry in our system



  # The "fields" section lists all the data points we want in each log
 
  fields:
      
    # FIELD 1: TIMESTAMP
      ========================================================================
    # PURPOSE: Records the exact time when an event occurred
    # WHY: Critical for debugging - helps you trace when problems started
    # EXAMPLE: "2024-02-13 14:23:45"
    - name: timestamp                       # Field identifier (used in code)
      type: string                          # Data type - text format
      required: yes                         # Every log MUST have this
      format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"        # Expected date format
      example: "2024-02-13 14:23:45"       # Sample value
      description: "Exact time when the event occurred"
    
    # FIELD 2: LEVEL
    # ========================================================================
    # PURPOSE: Indicates how serious/important this log is
    # WHY: Helps filter logs - focus on errors, ignore info messages
    # OPTIONS: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
    - name: level                           # Field identifier
      type: string                          # Data type
      required: yes                         # Every log MUST have a level
      options: [INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL]  # Only these 4 values allowed
      example: "ERROR"                      # Sample value
      description: "Severity level of the log entry"
      # LEVEL MEANINGS:
      # INFO     = Normal operation (user logged in, file saved)
      # WARNING  = Something unusual but not broken (disk 80% full)
      # ERROR    = Something failed (payment declined, API timeout)
      # CRITICAL = System in danger (database down, out of memory)
    
    # FIELD 3: SERVICE
    # ========================================================================
    # PURPOSE: Identifies which application/service created this log
    # WHY: When you have 10 services, you need to know which one has problems
    # EXAMPLE: "payment-service", "auth-service", "database-service"
    - name: service                         # Field identifier
      type: string                          # Data type
      required: yes                         # Every log must specify its source
      example: "payment-service"            # Sample service name
      description: "Name of the application/service that generated this log"
    
    # FIELD 4: MESSAGE
    # ========================================================================
    # PURPOSE: Human-readable description of what happened
    # WHY: This is what developers read to understand the event
    # EXAMPLE: "Payment transaction failed due to insufficient funds"
    - name: message                         # Field identifier
      type: string                          # Data type
      required: yes                         # Every log needs a message
      example: "Payment transaction failed due to insufficient funds"
      description: "Human-readable description of what happened"
    
  
    # FIELD 5: USER_ID 
    # ========================================================================
    # PURPOSE: Links the log to a specific user
    # WHY: Helps debug user-specific issues, track user behavior
    # WHEN TO USE: Any action triggered by a user (login, purchase, upload)
    - name: user_id                         # Field identifier
      type: string                          # Data type
      required: no                          # Optional - not all logs have a user
      example: "user_12345"                 # Sample user identifier
      description: "Unique identifier of the user who triggered this event"
    
    # FIELD 6: REQUEST_ID
    # ========================================================================
    # PURPOSE: Traces a single request across multiple services
    # WHY: When a user action involves 5 services, this connects all logs
    # EXAMPLE: User clicks "Buy" → auth-service → payment-service → 
    #          inventory-service → email-service (same request_id in all)
    - name: request_id                      # Field identifier
      type: string                          # Data type
      required: no                          # Optional
      example: "req_abc123xyz"              # Sample request ID
      description: "Unique ID to trace a request across multiple services"
    
    # FIELD 7: ERROR_CODE (Optional)
    # ========================================================================
    # PURPOSE: Machine-readable error identifier
    # WHY: Easier to search/filter than human messages
    # EXAMPLE: "ERR_TIMEOUT", "ERR_INVALID_INPUT", "ERR_DATABASE_DOWN"
    - name: error_code                      # Field identifier
      type: string                          # Data type
      required: no                          # Only present when there's an error
      example: "ERR_TIMEOUT"                # Sample error code
      description: "Specific error code for programmatic handling"
    
    # FIELD 8: DURATION_MS (Optional)
    # ========================================================================
    # PURPOSE: How long did the operation take?
    # WHY: Detect performance problems (API calls taking 10 seconds instead of 100ms)
    # UNIT: Milliseconds (1000ms = 1 second)
    - name: duration_ms                     # Field identifier
      type: number                          # Data type - numeric value
      required: no                          # Optional
      example: 1250                         # Sample: 1.25 seconds
      description: "Time taken to complete the operation in milliseconds"
    
    # FIELD 9: IP_ADDRESS (Optional)
    # ========================================================================
    # PURPOSE: Where did the request come from?
    # WHY: Security (detect attacks from specific IPs), debugging
    # EXAMPLE: "192.168.1.100", "10.0.0.5"
    - name: ip_address                      # Field identifier
      type: string                          # Data type
      required: no                          # Optional
      example: "192.168.1.100"              # Sample IP
      description: "IP address of the client making the request"


# EXAMPLE LOG ENTRIES
